<h1>NAME</h1>
<p>nvidia-smi - NVIDIA System Management Interface program</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p>nvidia-smi [OPTION1 [ARG1]] [OPTION2 [ARG2]] ...</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>nvidia-smi (also NVSMI) provides monitoring and management
capabilities for each of NVIDIA's Tesla, Quadro, GRID and GeForce
devices from Fermi and higher architecture families. GeForce Titan
series devices are supported for most functions with very limited
information provided for the remainder of the Geforce brand. NVSMI is a
cross platform tool that supports all standard NVIDIA driver-supported
Linux distros, as well as 64bit versions of Windows starting with
Windows Server 2008 R2. Metrics can be consumed directly by users via
stdout, or provided by file via CSV and XML formats for scripting
purposes.</p>
<p>Note that much of the functionality of NVSMI is provided by the
underlying NVML C-based library. See the NVIDIA developer website link
below for more information about NVML. NVML-based python bindings are
also available.</p>
<p>The output of NVSMI is not guaranteed to be backwards compatible.
However, both NVML and the Python bindings are backwards compatible, and
should be the first choice when writing any tools that must be
maintained across NVIDIA driver releases.</p>

<p>List each of the excluded NVIDIA GPUs in the system, along with their
UUIDs.</p>
<h2>SUMMARY OPTIONS</h2>
<h2>Show a summary of GPUs connected to the system.</h2>
<h2>-col, --columns</h2>
<p>Show a summary of GPUs connected to the system in a multi-column
format.</p>

<p>Log to the specified file, rather than to stdout.</p>
<h2>-l SEC, --loop=SEC</h2>
<p>Probe until Ctrl+C at specified second interval.</p>
<h2>QUERY OPTIONS</h2>
<h2>-q, --query</h2>
<p>Display GPU or Unit info. Displayed info includes all data listed in
the (<em>GPU ATTRIBUTES</em>) or (<em>UNIT ATTRIBUTES</em>) sections of
this document. Some devices and/or environments don't support all
possible information. Any unsupported data is indicated by a "N/A" in
the output. By default information for all available GPUs or Units is
displayed. Use the <strong>-i</strong> option to restrict the output to
a single GPU or Unit.</p>
<h2>[plus optionally]</h2>
<h2>-u, --unit</h2>
<p>Display Unit data instead of GPU data. Unit data is only available
for NVIDIA S-class Tesla enclosures.</p>
<h2>-i, --id=ID</h2>
<p>Display data for a single specified GPU or Unit. The specified id may
be the GPU/Unit's 0-based index in the natural enumeration returned by
the driver, the GPU's board serial number, the GPU's UUID, or the GPU's
PCI bus ID (as domain:bus:device.function in hex). It is recommended
that users desiring consistency use either UUID or PCI bus ID, since
device enumeration ordering is not guaranteed to be consistent between
reboots and board serial number might be shared between multiple GPUs on
the same board.</p>
<h2>-f FILE, --filename=FILE</h2>
<p>Redirect query output to the specified file in place of the default
stdout. The specified file will be overwritten.</p>
<h2>-x, --xml-format</h2>
<p>Produce XML output in place of the default human-readable format.
Both GPU and Unit query outputs conform to corresponding DTDs. These are
available via the <strong>--dtd</strong> flag.</p>
<h2>--dtd</h2>
<p>Use with <strong>-x</strong>. Embed the DTD in the XML output.</p>
<h2>--debug=FILE</h2>
<p>Produces an encrypted debug log for use in submission of bugs back to
NVIDIA.</p>
<h2>-d TYPE, --display=TYPE</h2>
<p>Display only selected information: MEMORY, UTILIZATION, ECC,
TEMPERATURE, POWER, CLOCK, COMPUTE, PIDS, PERFORMANCE, SUPPORTED_CLOCKS,
PAGE_RETIREMENT, ACCOUNTING, ENCODER_STATS, SUPPORTED_GPU_TARGET_TEMP,
VOLTAGE, FBC_STATS, ROW_REMAPPER, GSP_FIRMWARE_VERSION, POWER_SMOOTHING,
POWER_PROFILES. Flags can be combined with comma e.g. "MEMORY,ECC".
Sampling data with max, min and avg is also returned for POWER,
UTILIZATION and CLOCK display types. Doesn't work with -u/--unit or
-x/--xml-format flags.</p>
<h2>-l SEC, --loop=SEC</h2>
<p>Continuously report query data at the specified interval, rather than
the default of just once. The application will sleep in-between queries.
Note that on Linux ECC error or Xid error events will print out during
the sleep period if the -x flag was not specified. Pressing Ctrl+C at
any time will abort the loop, which will otherwise run indefinitely. If
no argument is specified for the <strong>-l</strong> form a default
interval of 5 seconds is used.</p>
<h2>-lms ms, --loop-ms=ms</h2>
<p>Same as -l,--loop but in milliseconds.</p>
<h2>SELECTIVE QUERY OPTIONS</h2>
<p>Allows the caller to pass an explicit list of properties to
query.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>csv - comma separated values (MANDATORY)</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>noheader - skip first line with column headers</p></li>

<li><p>nounits - don't print units for numerical values</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>[plus any of]</h2>
<h2>-i, --id=ID</h2>
<p>Display data for a single specified GPU. The specified id may be the
GPU's 0-based index in the natural enumeration returned by the driver,
the GPU's board serial number, the GPU's UUID, or the GPU's PCI bus ID
(as domain:bus:device.function in hex). It is recommended that users
desiring consistency use either UUID or PCI bus ID, since device
enumeration ordering is not guaranteed to be consistent between reboots

same board.</p>
<h2>-f FILE, --filename=FILE</h2>
<p>Redirect query output to the specified file in place of the default
stdout. The specified file will be overwritten.</p>
<h2>-l SEC, --loop=SEC</h2>
<p>Continuously report query data at the specified interval, rather than
the default of just once. The application will sleep in-between queries.
Note that on Linux ECC error or Xid error events will print out during
the sleep period if the -x flag was not specified. Pressing Ctrl+C at
any time will abort the loop, which will otherwise run indefinitely. If
no argument is specified for the <strong>-l</strong> form a default
interval of 5 seconds is used.</p>
<h2>-lms ms, --loop-ms=ms</h2>
<p>Same as -l,--loop but in milliseconds.</p>
<h2>DEVICE MODIFICATION OPTIONS</h2>
<h2>[any one of]</h2>
<h2>-pm, --persistence-mode=MODE</h2>
<p>Set the persistence mode for the target GPUs. See the (<em>GPU
ATTRIBUTES</em>) section for a description of persistence mode. Requires
root. Will impact all GPUs unless a single GPU is specified using the -i
argument. The effect of this operation is immediate. However, it does
not persist across reboots. After each reboot persistence mode will
default to "Disabled". Available on Linux only.</p>
<h2>-e, --ecc-config=CONFIG</h2>
<p>Set the ECC mode for the target GPUs. See the (<em>GPU
ATTRIBUTES</em>) section for a description of ECC mode. Requires root.
Will impact all GPUs unless a single GPU is specified using the -i
argument. This setting takes effect after the next reboot and is
persistent.</p>
<h2>-p, --reset-ecc-errors=TYPE</h2>
<p>Reset the ECC error counters for the target GPUs. See the (<em>GPU
ATTRIBUTES</em>) section for a description of ECC error counter types.
Available arguments are 0\|VOLATILE or 1\|AGGREGATE. Requires root. Will
impact all GPUs unless a single GPU is specified using the -i argument.
The effect of this operation is immediate. Clearing aggregate counts is
not supported on Ampere+</p>
<h2>-c, --compute-mode=MODE</h2>
<p>Set the compute mode for the target GPUs. See the (<em>GPU
ATTRIBUTES</em>) section for a description of compute mode. Requires
root. Will impact all GPUs unless a single GPU is specified using the -i
argument. The effect of this operation is immediate. However, it does
not persist across reboots. After each reboot compute mode will reset to
"DEFAULT".</p>
<h2>-dm TYPE, --driver-model=TYPE</h2>
<h2>-fdm TYPE, --force-driver-model=TYPE</h2>
<p>Enable or disable TCC driver model. For Windows only. Requires
administrator privileges. -dm will fail if a display is attached, but
-fdm will force the driver model to change. Will impact all GPUs unless
a single GPU is specified using the -i argument. A reboot is required
for the change to take place. See <strong>Driver Model</strong> for more
information on Windows driver models. An error message indicates that
retrieving the field failed.</p>
<h2>--gom=MODE</h2>
<p>Set GPU Operation Mode: 0/ALL_ON, 1/COMPUTE, 2/LOW_DP Supported on
GK110 M-class and X-class Tesla products from the Kepler family. Not
supported on Quadro and Tesla C-class products. LOW_DP and ALL_ON are
the only modes supported on GeForce Titan devices. Requires
administrator privileges. See <em>GPU Operation Mode</em> for more
information about GOM. GOM changes take effect after reboot. The reboot
requirement might be removed in the future. Compute only GOMs don't
support WDDM (Windows Display Driver Model)</p>
<h2>-r, --gpu-reset</h2>
<p>Trigger a reset of one or more GPUs. Can be used to clear GPU HW and
SW state in situations that would otherwise require a machine reboot.
Typically useful if a double bit ECC error has occurred. Optional -i
switch can be used to target one or more specific devices. Without this
option, all GPUs are reset. Requires root. There can't be any
applications using these devices (e.g. CUDA application, graphics
application like X server, monitoring application like other instance of
nvidia-smi). There also can't be any compute applications running on any
other GPU in the system if individual GPU reset is not feasible.</p>
<p>Starting with the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, GPUs with NVLink
connections can be individually reset. On Ampere NVSwitch systems,
Fabric Manager is required to facilitate reset. On Hopper and later
NVSwitch systems, the dependency on Fabric Manager to facilitate reset
is removed.</p>
<p>If Fabric Manager is not running, or if any of the GPUs being reset
are based on an architecture preceding the NVIDIA Ampere architecture,
any GPUs with NVLink connections to a GPU being reset must also be reset
in the same command. This can be done either by omitting the -i switch,
or using the -i switch to specify the GPUs to be reset. If the -i option
does not specify a complete set of NVLink GPUs to reset, this command
will issue an error identifying the additional GPUs that must be
included in the reset command.</p>
<p>Specific details are outlined in the tables below:</p>
<p>NVSwitch systems:</p>
<pre><code> GPU Family | Fabric Manager running       | Fabric Manager not running   
------------|------------------------------|------------------------------
 Pre-Ampere | All PEER connected GPUs must | All PEER connected GPUs must 
            | be reset in same command.    | be reset in same command     
 Ampere+    | Each GPU can be reset        | All PEER connected GPUs must 
            | individually                 | be reset in same command     
</code></pre>
<p>Direct connected NVLink systems: (FM is not supported, as no NVSwitch
HW is present)</p>
<pre><code> GPU Family | Capabilities                                          
------------|-------------------------------------------------------
 Pre-Ampere | All PEER connected GPUs must be reset in same command 
 Ampere+    | Each GPU can be reset individually                    
</code></pre>
<p>GPU reset is not guaranteed to work in all cases. It is not
recommended for production environments at this time. In some situations
there may be HW components on the board that fail to revert back to an
initial state following the reset request. This is more likely to be
seen on Fermi-generation products vs. Kepler, and more likely to be seen
if the reset is being performed on a hung GPU.</p>
<p>Following a reset, it is recommended that the health of each reset
GPU be verified before further use. If any GPU is not healthy a complete
reset should be instigated by power cycling the node.</p>
<p>Reset triggered without extra arguments, will be a default Function
Level Reset (FLR). To issue a Bus Reset, use -r bus. For certain
platforms only Function Level Reset is possible.</p>
<p>GPU reset operation will not be supported on MIG enabled vGPU
guests.</p>

3/VGPU or 4/VSGA. Virtualization mode of a GPU can only be set when it
is running on a hypervisor.</p>
<h2>-lgc, --lock-gpu-clocks=MIN_GPU_CLOCK,MAX_GPU_CLOCK</h2>
<p>Specifies &lt;minGpuClock,maxGpuClock&gt; clocks as a pair (e.g.
1500,1500) that defines closest desired locked GPU clock speed in MHz.
Input can also use be a singular desired clock value (e.g.
&lt;GpuClockValue&gt;). Optionally, --mode can be supplied to specify
the clock locking modes. Supported on Volta+. Requires root.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--mode=0 (Default)</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This mode is the default clock locking mode and provides the highest
possible frequency accuracies supported by the hardware.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>--mode=1</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The clock locking algorithm leverages close loop controllers to
achieve frequency accuracies with improved perf per watt for certain
class of applications. Due to convergence latency of close loop
controllers, the frequency accuracies may be slightly lower than default
mode 0.</p>

<h1>GPU ATTRIBUTES</h1>
<p>The following list describes all possible data returned by the
<strong>-q</strong> device query option. Unless otherwise noted all
numerical results are base 10 and unitless.</p>
<h2>Timestamp</h2>
<p>The current system timestamp at the time nvidia-smi was invoked.
Format is "Day-of-week Month Day HH:MM:SS Year".</p>
<h2>Driver Version</h2>
<p>The version of the installed NVIDIA display driver. This is an
alphanumeric string.</p>
<h2>CUDA Version</h2>
<p>The latest CUDA version supported by the driver. This is usually, but
not always, the version of the CUDA toolkit installed on the system.
This is an alphanumeric string.</p>
<h2>Attached GPUs</h2>
<p>The number of NVIDIA GPUs in the system.</p>
<h2>Product Name</h2>
<p>The official product name of the GPU. This is an alphanumeric string.
For all products.</p>
<h2>Product Brand</h2>
<p>The official brand of the GPU. This is an alphanumeric string. For
all products.</p>
<h2>Product Architecture</h2>
<p>The official architecture name of the GPU. This is an alphanumeric
string. For all products.</p>
<h2>Display Mode</h2>
<p>This field is deprecated, and will be removed in a future
release.</p>
<h2>Display Attached</h2>
<p>A flag that indicates whether a physical display (e.g. monitor) is
currently connected to any of the GPU's connectors. "Yes" indicates an
attached display. "No" indicates otherwise.</p>
<h2>Display Active</h2>
<p>A flag that indicates whether a display is initialized on the GPU's
(e.g. memory is allocated on the device for display). Display can be
active even when no monitor is physically attached. "Enabled" indicates
an active display. "Disabled" indicates otherwise.</p>
<h2>Persistence Mode</h2>
<p>A flag that indicates whether persistence mode is enabled for the
GPU. Value is either "Enabled" or "Disabled". When persistence mode is
enabled the NVIDIA driver remains loaded even when no active clients,
such as X11 or nvidia-smi, exist. This minimizes the driver load latency
associated with running dependent apps, such as CUDA programs. For all
CUDA-capable products. Linux only.</p>
<h2>Addressing Mode</h2>
<p>A field that indicates which addressing mode is currently active. The
value is "ATS" or "HMM" or "None". When the mode is "ATS", system
allocated memory like malloc is addressable from the GPU via Address
Translation Services. This means there is effectively a single set of
page tables used by both the CPU and the GPU. When the mode is "HMM",
system allocated memory like malloc is addressable from the GPU via
software-based mirroring of the CPU's page tables, on the GPU. When the
mode is "None", neither ATS nor HMM is active. Linux only.</p>

<h2>Accounting Mode</h2>
<p>A flag that indicates whether accounting mode is enabled for the GPU.
Value is either "Enabled" or "Disabled". When accounting is enabled
statistics are calculated for each compute process running on the GPU.
Statistics can be queried during the lifetime or after termination of
the process. The execution time of process is reported as 0 while the
process is in running state and updated to actual execution time after
the process has terminated. See --help-query-accounted-apps for more
info.</p>
<h2>Accounting Mode Buffer Size</h2>
<p>Returns the size of the circular buffer that holds list of processes
that can be queried for accounting stats. This is the maximum number of
processes that accounting information will be stored for before
information about oldest processes will get overwritten by information
about new processes.</p>
<h2>Driver Model</h2>
<p>On Windows, the TCC and WDDM driver models are supported. The driver
model can be changed with the (-dm) or (-fdm) flags. The TCC driver
model is optimized for compute applications. I.E. kernel launch times
will be quicker with TCC. The WDDM driver model is designed for graphics
applications and is not recommended for compute applications. Linux does
not support multiple driver models, and will always have the value of
"N/A".</p>

<h2>GPU Recovery Action</h2>
<p>Action to take to clear fault that previously happened. It is not
intended for determining which fault triggered recovery action.<br />
Possible values: None, Reset, Reboot, Drain P2P, Drain and Reset</p>
<p><strong>None</strong></p>
<p>No recovery action needed</p>
<p><strong>Reset</strong></p>
<p>Example scenario - Uncontained HBM/SRAM UCE<br />
The GPU has encountered a fault that requires a reset to recover.<br />
Terminate all GPU processes, reset the GPU using 'nvidia-smi -r', and
the GPU can be used again by starting new GPU processes.</p>
<p><strong>Reboot</strong></p>
<p>Example scenario - UVM fatal error<br />
The GPU has encountered a fault may have left the OS in an inconsistent
state.<br />
Reboot the operating system to restore the OS back to a consistent
state.<br />
Node reboot required.<br />
Application cannot restart without node reboot<br />
OS warm reboot is sufficient (no need for AC/DC cycle)</p>
<p><strong>Drain P2P</strong></p>
<p>Example scenario - N/A<br />
The GPU has encountered a fault that requires all peer-to-peer traffic
to be quiesced.<br />
Terminate all GPU processes that conduct peer-to-peer traffic and
disable UVM persistence mode.<br />
Disable job scheduling (no new jobs), stop all applications when
convenient, if persistence mode is enabled, disable it<br />
Once all peer-to-peer traffic are drained, query
NVML_FI_DEV_GET_GPU_RECOVERY_ACTION again, which will return one of the
other actions.<br />
If still DRAIN_P2P, then GPU reset.</p>
<p><strong>Drain and Reset</strong></p>
<p>Example scenario - Contained HBM UCE<br />
Reset Recommended.<br />
The GPU has encountered a fault that results the GPU to temporarily
operate at a reduced capacity, such as part of its frame buffer memory
being offlined, or some of its MIG partitions down.<br />
No new work should be scheduled on the GPU, but existing work that
didn't get affected are safe to continue until they finish or reach a
good checkpoint.<br />
Safe to restart application (memory capacity will be reduced due to
dynamic page offlining), but need to eventually reset (to get row
remap).<br />
Asserted only for UCE row remaps.<br />
After all existing work have drained, reset the GPU to regain its full
capacity.</p>

<h2>Sparse Operation Mode</h2>
<p>A flag that indicates whether sparse operation mode is enabled for
the GPU. Value is either "Enabled" or "Disabled". Reported as "N/A" if
not supported.</p>
<h2>FB Memory Usage</h2>
<p>On-board frame buffer memory information. Reported total memory can
be affected by ECC state. If ECC does affect the total available memory,
memory is decreased by several percent, due to the requisite parity
bits. The driver may also reserve a small amount of memory for internal
use, even without active work on the GPU. On systems where GPUs are NUMA
nodes, the accuracy of FB memory utilization provided by nvidia-smi
depends on the memory accounting of the operating system. This is
because FB memory is managed by the operating system instead of the
NVIDIA GPU driver. Typically, pages allocated from FB memory are not
released even after the process terminates to enhance performance. In
scenarios where the operating system is under memory pressure, it may
resort to utilizing FB memory. Such actions can result in discrepancies
in the accuracy of memory reporting. For all products.</p>

<h2>Compute Mode</h2>
<p>The compute mode flag indicates whether individual or multiple
compute applications may run on the GPU.</p>
<p>"Default" means multiple contexts are allowed per device.</p>
<p>"Exclusive Process" means only one context is allowed per device,
usable from multiple threads at a time.</p>
<p>"Prohibited" means no contexts are allowed per device (no compute
apps).</p>
<p>"EXCLUSIVE_PROCESS" was added in CUDA 4.0. Prior CUDA releases
supported only one exclusive mode, which is equivalent to
"EXCLUSIVE_THREAD" in CUDA 4.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>For all CUDA-capable products.</p>
<h2>Utilization</h2>
<p>Utilization rates report how busy each GPU is over time, and can be
used to determine how much an application is using the GPUs in the
system. Note: On MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the utilization of encoder,
decoder, jpeg, ofa, gpu, and memory is not currently supported.</p>
<p>Note: During driver initialization when ECC is enabled one can see
high GPU and Memory Utilization readings. This is caused by ECC Memory
Scrubbing mechanism that is performed during driver initialization.</p>

<h2>ECC Errors</h2>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs can provide error counts for various types of ECC errors.
Some ECC errors are either single or double bit, where single bit errors
are corrected and double bit errors are uncorrectable. Texture memory
errors may be correctable via resend or uncorrectable if the resend
fails. These errors are available across two timescales (volatile and
aggregate). Single bit ECC errors are automatically corrected by the HW
and do not result in data corruption. Double bit errors are detected but
not corrected. Please see the ECC documents on the web for information
on compute application behavior when double bit errors occur. Volatile
error counters track the number of errors detected since the last driver
load. Aggregate error counts persist indefinitely and thus act as a
lifetime counter.</p>
<p>A note about volatile counts: On Windows this is once per boot. On
Linux this can be more frequent. On Linux the driver unloads when no
active clients exist. Hence, if persistence mode is enabled or there is
always a driver client active (e.g. X11), then Linux also sees per-boot
behavior. If not, volatile counts are reset each time a compute app is
run.</p>
<p>Tesla and Quadro products pre-volta can display total ECC error
counts, as well as a breakdown of errors based on location on the chip.
The locations are described below. Location-based data for aggregate
error counts requires Inforom ECC object version 2.0. All other ECC
counts require ECC object version 1.0.</p>

<h2>Page Retirement</h2>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs can retire pages of GPU device memory when they become
unreliable. This can happen when multiple single bit ECC errors occur
for the same page, or on a double bit ECC error. When a page is retired,
the NVIDIA driver will hide it such that no driver, or application
memory allocations can access it.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bit ECC</strong> The number of GPU device memory pages
that have been retired due to a double bit ECC error.</p>
<p><strong>Single Bit ECC</strong> The number of GPU device memory pages
that have been retired due to multiple single bit ECC errors.</p>
<p><strong>Pending</strong> Checks if any GPU device memory pages are
pending blacklist on the next reboot. Pages that are retired but not yet
blacklisted can still be allocated, and may cause further reliability
issues.</p>
<h2>Row Remapper</h2>
<p>NVIDIA GPUs can remap rows of GPU device memory when they become
unreliable. This can happen when a single uncorrectable ECC error or
multiple correctable ECC errors occur on the same row. When a row is
remapped, the NVIDIA driver will remap the faulty row to a reserved row.
All future accesses to the row will access the reserved row instead of
the faulty row. This feature is available on Ampere+</p>
<p><strong>Correctable Error</strong> The number of rows that have been
remapped due to correctable ECC errors.</p>
<p><strong>Uncorrectable Error</strong> The number of rows that have
been remapped due to uncorrectable ECC errors.</p>
<p><strong>Pending</strong> Indicates whether or not a row is pending
remapping. The GPU must be reset for the remapping to go into
effect.</p>
<p><strong>Remapping Failure Occurred</strong> Indicates whether or not
a row remapping has failed in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Bank Remap Availability Histogram</strong> Each memory bank
has a fixed number of reserved rows that can be used for row remapping.
The histogram will classify the remap availability of each bank into
Maximum, High, Partial, Low and None. Maximum availability means that
all reserved rows are available for remapping while None means that no
reserved rows are available. Correctable row remappings don't count
towards the availability histogram since row remappings due to
correctable row remappings can be evicted by an uncorrectable row
remapping.</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>Readings from temperature sensors on the board. All readings are in
degrees C. Not all products support all reading types. In particular,
products in module form factors that rely on case fans or passive
cooling do not usually provide temperature readings. See below for
restrictions.</p>
<p>T.Limit: The T.Limit sensor measures the current margin in degree
Celsius to the maximum operating temperature. As such it is not an
absolute temperature reading rather a relative measurement.</p>
<p>Not all products support T.Limit sensor readings.</p>
<p>When supported, nvidia-smi reports the current T.Limit temperature as
a signed value that counts down. A T.Limit temperature of 0 C or lower
indicates that the GPU may optimize its clock based on thermal
conditions. Further, when the T.Limit sensor is supported, available
temperature thresholds are also reported relative to T.Limit (see below)
instead of absolute measurements.</p>

the GPU will still attempt to maintain this floor, but will
opportunistically boost to higher clocks when power, thermal and
utilization headroom allow. This setting persists for the life of the

<h2>Device Monitoring</h2>
<p>The "nvidia-smi dmon" command-line is used to monitor one or more
GPUs (up to 16 devices) plugged into the system. This tool allows the
user to see one line of monitoring data per monitoring cycle. The output
is in concise format and easy to interpret in interactive mode. The
output data per line is limited by the terminal size. It is supported on
Tesla, GRID, Quadro and limited GeForce products for Kepler or newer
GPUs under bare metal 64 bits Linux. By default, the monitoring data
includes Power Usage, Temperature, SM clocks, Memory clocks and
Utilization values for SM, Memory, Encoder, Decoder, JPEG and OFA. It
can also be configured to report other metrics such as frame buffer
memory usage, bar1 memory usage, power/thermal violations and aggregate
single/double bit ecc errors. If any of the metric is not supported on
the device or any other error in fetching the metric is reported as "-"
in the output data. The user can also configure monitoring frequency and
the number of monitoring iterations for each run. There is also an
option to include date and time at each line. All the supported options
are exclusive and can be used together in any order. Note: On
MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the utilization of encoder, decoder, jpeg,
ofa, gpu, and memory is not currently supported.</p>

<h2>Daemon (EXPERIMENTAL)</h2>
<p>The "nvidia-smi daemon" starts a background process to monitor one or
more GPUs plugged in to the system. It monitors the requested GPUs every
monitoring cycle and logs the file in compressed format at the user
provided path or the default location at /var/log/nvstats/. The log file
is created with system's date appended to it and of the format
nvstats-YYYYMMDD. The flush operation to the log file is done every
alternate monitoring cycle. Daemon also logs it's own PID at
/var/run/nvsmi.pid. By default, the monitoring data to persist includes
Power Usage, Temperature, SM clocks, Memory clocks and Utilization
values for SM, Memory, Encoder, Decoder, JPEG and OFA. The daemon tools
can also be configured to record other metrics such as frame buffer
memory usage, bar1 memory usage, power/thermal violations and aggregate
single/double bit ecc errors.The default monitoring cycle is set to 10
secs and can be configured via command-line. It is supported on Tesla,
GRID, Quadro and GeForce products for Kepler or newer GPUs under bare
metal 64 bits Linux. The daemon requires root privileges to run, and
only supports running a single instance on the system. All of the
supported options are exclusive and can be used together in any order.
Note: On MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the utilization of encoder, decoder,
jpeg, ofa, gpu, and memory is not currently supported.

clocks and Utilization values for SM, Memory, Encoder, Decoder, JPEG and
OFA. The replay tool can also fetch other metrics such as frame buffer
memory usage, bar1 memory usage, power/thermal violations and aggregate
single/double bit ecc errors. There is an option to select a set of
metrics to replay, If any of the requested metric is not maintained or
logged as not-supported then it's shown as "-" in the output. The format
of data produced by this mode is such that the user is running the
device monitoring utility interactively. The command line requires
mandatory option "-f" to specify complete path of the log filename, all
the other supported options are exclusive and can be used together in
any order. Note: On MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the utilization of
encoder, decoder, jpeg, ofa, gpu, and memory is not currently supported.

<h2>Process Monitoring</h2>
<p>The "nvidia-smi pmon" command-line is used to monitor compute and
graphics processes running on one or more GPUs (up to 16 devices)
plugged into the system. This tool allows the user to see the statistics
for all the running processes on each device at every monitoring cycle.
The output is in concise format and easy to interpret in interactive
mode. The output data per line is limited by the terminal size. It is
supported on Tesla, GRID, Quadro and limited GeForce products for Kepler
or newer GPUs under bare metal 64 bits Linux. By default, the monitoring
data for each process includes the pid, command name and average
utilization values for SM, Memory, Encoder and Decoder since the last
monitoring cycle. It can also be configured to report frame buffer
memory usage for each process. If there is no process running for the
device, then all the metrics are reported as "-" for the device. If any
of the metric is not supported on the device or any other error in
fetching the metric is also reported as "-" in the output data. The user
can also configure monitoring frequency and the number of monitoring
iterations for each run. There is also an option to include date and
time at each line. All the supported options are exclusive and can be
used together in any order. Note: On MIG-enabled GPUs, querying the
utilization of encoder, decoder, jpeg, ofa, gpu, and memory is not

<h2>Topology</h2>
<p>List topology information about the system's GPUs, how they connect
to each other, their CPU and memory affinities as well as qualified NICs
capable of RDMA.</p>
<p>Note: On some systems, a NIC is used as a PCI bridge for the NVLINK
switches and is not useful from a networking or RDMA point of view. The
nvidia-smi topo command will filter the NIC's ports/PCIe sub-functions
out of the topology matrix by examining the NIC's sysfs entries. On some
kernel versions, nvidia-smi requires root privileges to read these sysfs
entries.</p>

<h2>vGPU Management</h2>
<p>The "nvidia-smi vgpu" command reports on GRID vGPUs executing on
supported GPUs and hypervisors (refer to driver release notes for
supported platforms). Summary reporting provides basic information about
vGPUs currently executing on the system. Additional options provide
detailed reporting of vGPU properties, per-vGPU reporting of SM, Memory,
Encoder, Decoder, Jpeg, and OFA utilization, and per-GPU reporting of
supported and creatable vGPUs. Periodic reports can be automatically

<h1>DEPRECATON AND REMOVAL NOTICES</h1>
<h2>Features deprecated and/or removed between nvidia-smi v580 Update
and v575</h2>
<h2></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Removed deprecated graphics voltage value from Voltage section of
'nvidia-smi -q'</p></li>
<li><p>Removed deprecated GPU Reset Status from 'nvidia-smi -q'
output</p></li>
<li><p>Deprecated GPU Fabric State and Status from 'nvidia-smi
-q'</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>CHANGE LOG</h1>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<h2></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>On systems where GPUs are NUMA nodes, the accuracy of FB memory
utilization provided by nvidia-smi depends on the memory accounting of
the operating system. This is because FB memory is managed by the
operating system instead of the NVIDIA GPU driver. Typically, pages
allocated from FB memory are not released even after the process
terminates to enhance performance. In scenarios where the operating
system is under memory pressure, it may resort to utilizing FB memory.
Such actions can result in discrepancies in the accuracy of memory
reporting.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux GPU Reset can't be triggered when there is pending GOM
change.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux GPU Reset may not successfully change pending ECC mode.
A full reboot may be required to enable the mode change.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux platforms that configure NVIDIA GPUs as NUMA nodes,
enabling persistence mode or resetting GPUs may print 'Warning:
persistence mode is disabled on device' if nvidia-persistenced is not
running, or if nvidia-persistenced cannot access files in the NVIDIA
driver's procfs directory for the device
(/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/&lt;PCI config='' address&gt;=''&gt;/). During
GPU reset and driver reload, this directory will be deleted and
recreated, and outstanding references to the deleted directory, such as
mounts or shells, can prevent processes from accessing files in the new
directory.</p></li>
<li><p>There might be a slight discrepency between volatile/aggregate
ECC counters if recovery action was not taken</p></li>
<li><p>The GPU hostname commands are currently only supported on
compatible GB200 platforms.</p></li>
</ul>
